# About Me

Hi there! 👋 I’m **Kevin Eppacher**, a robotic software engineer passionate about perception-driven autonomy, intelligent control, and semantic understanding in robotics. 🤖  

I earned my **B.Sc. in Mechatronics & Robotics** and I’m currently pursuing my **M.Sc. in Robotics** at [UAS Technikum Vienna](https://www.technikum-wien.at/), where I focus on computer vision, probabilistic robotics, and nonlinear optimization. Over the past years, I’ve worked both in **research and industry**, building intelligent robotic systems that connect perception, planning, and action through modern AI frameworks.

I previously worked as an **Industrial Robotics Software Engineer** at [Blue Danube Robotics (AIRSKIN)](https://www.airskin.io/), where I developed robotic applications for safety, palletizing, and automated testing. My current research project, **SAGE – Semantic-Aware Guided Exploration**, explores how **Visual-Language Models (VLMs)** can drive autonomous exploration through 3D semantic mapping and persistent memory.

## What I Do

I design and implement algorithms that make robots *understand and interact with their environments* more intelligently, combining classical control, optimization, and machine learning.

Key areas I work in:

- **Semantic Perception**: Developing systems that map and interpret 3D environments using detection, segmentation, and visual-language reasoning.  
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Using reinforcement learning and behavior trees to enable adaptable and explainable robot actions.  
- **Optimization & Control**: Designing nonlinear MPC and planning frameworks for safe, smooth, and constraint-aware motion.  
- **Applied Robotics Engineering**: Delivering end-to-end robotic software from simulation to deployment, integrating sensors, hardware, and real-time systems.

I’m a strong advocate of **open-source robotics**, and most of my work, including my research code, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinEppacher).

## Outside the Lab

When I’m not developing or optimizing robot software, I enjoy **walking with my dog**, **street skateboarding** and **surfing**.

Feel free to explore my **Portfolio** to see the projects I’m working on, from industrial automation to semantic 3D exploration.  
I’m always open to new collaborations, creative research ideas, or just a conversation about robotics and AI. 🚀
